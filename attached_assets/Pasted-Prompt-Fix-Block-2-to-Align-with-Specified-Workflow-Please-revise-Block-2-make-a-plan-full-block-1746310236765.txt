Prompt: Fix Block 2 to Align with Specified Workflow

Please revise Block 2 (/make-a-plan/full/block-2) so that it fully reflects the intended three-step process and removes unnecessary confusion.

🧱 Step 3 – Link Heuristics to Success Factors
Display each user-created heuristic from Block 1.

Allow mapping of each to one of the 12 official TCOF success factors.

Add explanatory labels (“What”, “Why”, “How”) as per the original brief.

Ensure “Skip this step” is clearly shown and functional.

🧱 Step 4 – Identify Tasks per Heuristic
Allow users to create up to 3 tasks per heuristic for each stage (Identification, Definition, Delivery, Closure).

Ensure these tasks are auto-added to the checklist.

Show a small explanation of the goal for this section (see provided copy).

Remove the “Import Tasks from Database” button – it is not needed and confuses the user.

Automatically display the default tasks linked to the 12 TCOF success factors from the admin database. These should always be visible in this step and editable.

For clarity: users should see both their own tasks and the TCOF standard tasks side-by-side or grouped by source.

🧱 Step 5 – Add Organisational Policy Tasks
Keep this step as-is with manual input.

Provide fields for users to write tasks and assign them to a delivery stage.

Add brief instruction text.

🧱 Other Fixes
Visually separate Step 3, Step 4, and Step 5 (e.g. with cards, headers, or accordions).

If possible, persist any edits to heuristics/tasks with autosave or a clear “Save Progress” button.

All tasks created or added in Block 2 (user, TCOF, org policy) should be reflected in the checklist at the end.

❗Fix Missing Personal Heuristics in Block 1 & 2
Ensure that any heuristics created by the user in Block 1 Step 2 are:

Immediately shown on screen after entry

Saved automatically or via a clear Save/Continue button

Persisted to localStorage or Replit DB as appropriate

Passed through to Block 2 reliably

In Block 1, show all user-created heuristics in a list with:

Edit button

Option to “⭐ favourite” top heuristics

Optional delete button

In Block 2, use the saved heuristics as the input for Step 3.

This must not show “No heuristics found” if any have been added in Block 1.
