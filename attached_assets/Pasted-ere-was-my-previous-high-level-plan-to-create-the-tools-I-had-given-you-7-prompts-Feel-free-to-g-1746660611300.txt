ere was my previous high level plan to create the tools, I had given you 7 prompts, 

Feel free to give this a go.

"

1. Restructure the existing home page
“Replace the current Starter Kit Access page with two large buttons:
• Get Your Bearings – links to the page that already lists the three tools
• Make a Plan – links to a new landing page you will create next.
Add the same header bar on every page with links to Home, Get Your Bearings, Make a Plan, and Checklist (hidden until a plan is finished).”

2. Make-a-Plan landing page
“Under /make-a-plan build a landing page that explains the process and shows four clear options:
• Full Configuration
• Quick Start
• Continue Saved Plan
• Admin Preset Editor
Each option is a large card with a short description and a button that routes to the right URL.”

3. Block 1 page – Discover and Reflect
“Create /make-a-plan/full/block-1 with Step-by-step guidance, editable tables for rating the 12 TCOF success factors, a form to add personal heuristics, Back and Next buttons, Save Progress, and a Skip link to the checklist.”

4. Block 2 page – Connect and Build
“Create /make-a-plan/full/block-2.
• Step 3: optional mapping of heuristics to TCOF (include Skip).
• Step 4: table for up to three tasks per heuristic and stage.
• Step 5: form for adding organisation policy tasks.
Navigation and Save exactly as Block 1.”

5. Block 3 page – Complete and Confirm
“Create /make-a-plan/full/block-3.
• Step 6: two-question Praxis delivery approach selector, returning a zone and suggested techniques.
• Step 7: list good-practice tasks the user can tick to add (Skip allowed).
• Step 8: ‘Review & Generate’ button that builds the checklist then routes to /make-a-plan/checklist.
Include Back, Next, Save.”

6. Checklist page
“Create /make-a-plan/checklist.
Display four collapsible panels (Identification, Definition, Delivery, Closure).
Inside each, show three sub-lists: Your Heuristics, TCOF Factors, Good Practice Tasks, with check boxes.
Add Export to PDF and CSV.”
