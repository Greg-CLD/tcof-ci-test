Problem:
  The Block1Discover component is still showing the old “Importance Rating” column and not rendering our new five‐level “Resonance” controls.

Fix:
  1. **Remove Legacy Code**  
     - Open `client/src/pages/make-a-plan/Block1Discover.tsx`.  
     - Delete any `<th>` or `<td>` labeled “Importance” or “Select importance.”  
     - Remove any dead‐code branches, flags, or placeholders related to “importance.”  

  2. **Implement Resonance Scale**  
     - Define an array of options:
       ```ts
       const options = [
         { value: 1, symbol: '❌', label: "Doesn’t land",    desc: "I don’t feel this…" },
         { value: 2, symbol: '🤔', label: "Unfamiliar",      desc: "I’ve never seen it in action." },
         { value: 3, symbol: '🟡', label: "Seems true",     desc: "I believe it’s useful." },
         { value: 4, symbol: '✅', label: "Proven",         desc: "I’ve used this and it worked." },
         { value: 5, symbol: '🔥', label: "Hard-won truth", desc: "It’s burned into how I work." },
       ];
       ```
     - In the table header row, add `<th>Resonance</th>`.
     - For each factor row, render a `<fieldset>` or radio‐group showing those five tiles (symbol + label), with the description in a tooltip or beneath.
  
  3. **Wire Data & Persistence**  
     - Ensure you import and call `useResonanceRatings(projectId)`:
       - Initialize with `useQuery` to fetch existing ratings.
       - Use `useMutation` to save a single `{ factorId, resonance }` on change.
       - On success, invalidate the ratings query so the UI re‐renders.
  
  4. **Confirm at Runtime**  
     - Add a `console.log('🔧 Block1Discover updated with Resonance')` at the top of the component to verify your changes load.
     - Hard‐refresh the browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) and check the console.

  5. **Report Back**  
     After implementing these steps, reply with:
     - “✅ Legacy column removed”
     - “✅ Resonance UI implemented”
     - “✅ Data fetch & save working”
     - “✅ Runtime log visible in console”
