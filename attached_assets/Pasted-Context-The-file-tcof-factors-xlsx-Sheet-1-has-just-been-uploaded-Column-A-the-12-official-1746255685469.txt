Context
• The file /tcof_factors.xlsx (Sheet 1) has just been uploaded.
• Column A = the 12 official Success-Factor titles (including numbering e.g. “1.1 Ask Why”).
• Columns B–E = tasks for Identification, Definition, Delivery, Closure.
• We must replace all hard-coded titles/tasks with this data and show clear guidance + emoji key on Block 1.

Tasks

Parse Excel → JSON

Read /tcof_factors.xlsx Sheet 1.

Write data/tcofFactors.json in this structure:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
[
  { "id":"1.1", "title":"Ask Why",
    "tasks":{
      "Identification":["Consult key stakeholders", "Understand pains and wants", "Define goals"],
      "Definition":[], "Delivery":[], "Closure":[]
    }
  },
  …
]
Delete/overwrite any earlier factor JSON so this is the single source of truth.

Block 1 Step 1 / Step 2 guidance

In pages/Block1Discover.jsx, insert two collapsible <details> elements above the rating table, each with the exact text you supplied (“Step 1 – Reflect on the TCOF Heuristics…” and “Step 2 – Add Your Own Heuristics”). Style using .guidance class (background:#fff5e7; border-left:4px solid #008080;).

Render factor table from JSON

Replace the current hard-coded list with tcofFactors.map(...), preserving the spreadsheet order.

Emoji-rating key

Add a small link “Rating key” next to the table heading. Clicking opens a modal (or <dialog>) that displays:

❌ Doesn’t land – I don’t feel this. It doesn’t match my experience.  
🤔 Unfamiliar – I understand it, but I’ve never used it in action.  
🟡 Seems true – I believe it’s useful, but I haven’t tested it myself.  
✅ Proven – I’ve used this and it worked. It fits how I lead.  
🔥 Hard-won truth – I’ve lived this. It’s burned into how I work.
Each radio button keeps a title= attribute with the same description.

Update Quick-Start util (quickStartPlan)

Import tcofFactors.json instead of the old file.

For each factor:

create a default rating entry (rating 3, no notes).

push every task in each stage into plan.stages[stage].tasks with origin:'factor'.

Unit test tests/block1.factorTitles.test.jsx

Mount Block 1, assert getByText('1.1 Ask Why') is in the document.
