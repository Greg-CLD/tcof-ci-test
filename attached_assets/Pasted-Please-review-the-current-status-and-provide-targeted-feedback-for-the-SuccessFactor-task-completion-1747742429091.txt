Please review the current status and provide targeted feedback for the SuccessFactor task completion issue.
1. Situation Recap
	• Agent claims the UUID extraction fix is live and tested.
	• Agent reports passing unit and database tests for the extractUuid function.
	• Agent claims 500 error is resolved and that PUT requests now work.
	• However, in actual user testing:
		○ Marking a SuccessFactor task as done still returns a 500 error in the browser.
		○ The task completion status does not persist on refresh.
		○ The network request still shows a compound ID in the PUT endpoint and response.
		○ The server error is:"Failed to process task ID ...: invalid input syntax for type uuid: ..."
2. What to Review
	• Carefully review any smoke test/log output from Agent relating to this fix.(If Agent did not provide JSON results or logs, list what is missing.)
	• Request only what’s missing:
		○ Network Tab: Most recent PUT request (including endpoint URL, request body, and response body).
		○ Server Console: Snippet showing handling/logging of the PUT request for the failing task.
		○ SSR Logs: Any relevant server-side logs around the update attempt.
		○ GET /tasks JSON: Latest snapshot of the relevant project’s tasks (with the affected ID/status).
		○ Smoke-test Script Output: Results from the script that exercises task update & refresh.
3. Validation and User Testing
	• Explicitly check if Agent delivered:
		○ Correctly updated endpoint (PUT /tasks/:id with UUID only).
		○ JSON logs/results from smoke tests.
		○ SSR/server logs showing no type errors for taskId.
	• If anything is missing, list each artifact and request the Agent to supply or re-run the missing logs/output.
	• From a user side, confirm if any manual UI or UX testing is needed (e.g., should the user try a task completion flow again in the browser with DevTools open, and copy the network tab output?).
4. Next Assumptions
	• Assume Agent has not provided all requested outputs unless the log or artifact is pasted in full.
	• If Agent reports “success” but the error still occurs in real use, treat the bug as unfixed until proven otherwise with browser and server evidence.

Action:
	• Review and summarize what you actually have from Agent.
	• Identify missing items (see list above) and request them.
	• Tell me if I should re-test in the UI, and exactly what data (screenshot, JSON, console log, etc) you need next.
