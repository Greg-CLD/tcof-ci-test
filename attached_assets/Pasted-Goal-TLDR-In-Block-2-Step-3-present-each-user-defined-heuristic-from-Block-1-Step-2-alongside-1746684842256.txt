Goal/TLDR:
In Block 2 – Step 3, present each user-defined heuristic (from Block 1 Step 2) alongside a dropdown of the 12 Canonical TCOF Success Factors (plus “No Match”), persisting links via React Query and filtering linked heuristics out of later steps.

Prompt for the Agent:
	Title: Block 2 Step 3 – Heuristic ↔ Success-Factor Linking
	Goal: In Block 2 Step 3, enable users to map each of their custom heuristics (created in Block 1 Step 2) to one of the 12 TCOF Success Factors—or “No Match”—so that linked heuristics inherit their factor’s tasks in subsequent steps.
	Tasks:
	1. Component & Data Hooks
		○ File: client/src/pages/MakeAPlanBlock2Step3.tsx (or the existing Step 3 component).
		○ Import and use:
			§ usePersonalHeuristics(projectId) to fetch the heuristics list.
			§ useHeuristicLinks(projectId) to fetch and update mapping entries.
			§ React Query’s useMutation & useQueryClient for persistence.
	2. UI Layout
		○ For each heuristic in the list:
			§ Left cell: display heuristic.text.
			§ Right cell: a <Select> with:
				□ 12 fixed <SelectItem value="factorId">Factor Name</SelectItem>.
				□ <SelectItem value={null}>No Match / Not Applicable</SelectItem>.
		○ If no heuristics, show: “Add at least one heuristic in Block 1 before linking.”
	3. Link Behavior
		○ On dropdown change:
			§ Call mutation to upsert { projectId, heuristicId, factorId }.
			§ Invalidate ['heuristicLinks', projectId] so the UI refreshes.
		○ Pre-select existing links on load from useHeuristicLinks.
	4. Downstream Impact
		○ In Step 4 (task identification), automatically exclude any heuristics that have a non-null factorId, since they’ll inherit tasks from the linked factor.
	5. Styling & Accessibility
		○ Use existing UI components (SelectTrigger, SelectContent, etc.) and Tailwind utilities for layout.
		○ Ensure keyboard-accessible dropdown navigation.
	Deliverable:
		○ A functional Block 2 Step 3 screen where users link heuristics to success factors, with mappings persisted and linked heuristics filtered out in Step 4.
