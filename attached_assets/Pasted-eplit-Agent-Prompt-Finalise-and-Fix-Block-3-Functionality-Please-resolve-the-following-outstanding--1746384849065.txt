eplit Agent Prompt: Finalise and Fix Block 3 Functionality
Please resolve the following outstanding issues in Block 3 (/make-a-plan/full/block-3) to ensure consistent UX, correct logic, and expected task/checklist handling.

🎯 1. Fix Scope × Uncertainty Quadrant (Step 6)
✅ Adjust the axis layout and formatting:

Y-axis: “Uncertainty” – label on the left, values Low → High (bottom → top)

X-axis: “Scope” – label at the bottom, values Simple → Complex (left → right)

Top-right quadrant = High Scope + High Uncertainty = Zone E

✅ Axis labels should not be cut off, and each quadrant should clearly show:

Zone name (e.g. “Zone E”)

Optional label: e.g. “Agile/Hybrid Delivery”

✅ Remove any awkward vertical label formatting (e.g. “SmaZone A”)

🧹 2. Block Clearing Logic
✅ Fix the “Clear this Block” button in Block 3:

It should only clear data for Block 3

It should not clear any data entered in Block 2

🔄 3. Default Delivery Framework
✅ When a delivery zone is selected in Step 6, default the Praxis Framework as the associated delivery method (not UK Government Teal Book).

If any default tasks are preloaded, ensure they are from Praxis.

User can override by adding custom frameworks.

✅ 4. Step 7 – Good Practice (Framework Tasks)
✅ Add a “Clear All Tasks” button to Step 7:

Allows users to deselect all tasks in one click

✅ Refactor the “Custom Frameworks” UI to match Steps 4 & 5:

Left panel: list of framework names

Right panel: tabs or collapsible panels for stages (Identification, Definition, Delivery, Closure)

Add task per stage with autosave and placeholder fields

Friendly IDs should appear (e.g. Custom01 - Definition - Task 1)

💾 5. Block 3 Save & Return Bug
✅ Fix the Save Progress bug:

If the user saves Block 3, then navigates away (e.g. to Block 2), all custom frameworks and delivery selections should persist

The data should be retrieved on return to Block 3 without the user needing to trigger anything manually

Fix the bug where new entries cause old entries to reappear unexpectedly

📋 6. Step 8 – Final Checklist
✅ When the user clicks “Create My Checklist”:

The checklist should include:

✅ All 12 TCOF Success Factors and their tasks

✅ All User Heuristics + their tasks (from Step 4)

✅ All Organisation Policy tasks (Step 5)

✅ All Good Practice tasks (Step 7, including Praxis Framework if selected)

✅ All Custom Framework tasks
