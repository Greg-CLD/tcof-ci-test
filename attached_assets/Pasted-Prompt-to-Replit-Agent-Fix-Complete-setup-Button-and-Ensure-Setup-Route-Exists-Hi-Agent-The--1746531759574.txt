Prompt to Replit Agent — Fix “Complete setup” Button and Ensure Setup Route Exists

Hi Agent,

The “Complete setup” button on the project card view still does nothing. We need to wire it up properly and guarantee the setup page is routable. Please implement the following:

1. Add Click Handler to “Complete setup” Button
In the component where the button is defined (likely ProjectDashboardPage.tsx or ProjectOverview.tsx):

Import the useLocation hook from wouter:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { useLocation } from 'wouter';
Initialize navigate:

ts
Copy
Edit
const [, navigate] = useLocation();
Add an onClick to the button:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Button
  variant="default"
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('Complete setup clicked for project:', project.id);
    navigate(`/projects/${project.id}/setup`);
  }}
>
  Complete Setup
</Button>
Remove any stale or empty handlers so only this onClick remains.

2. Define and Wire the Setup Route
In your router (App.tsx or wherever routes are declared):

Add a route for /projects/:projectId/setup before any catch-alls:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Route path="/projects/:projectId/setup">
  {user ? (
    <ProtectedRouteGuard>
      <ProjectProfilePage editMode={true} />
    </ProtectedRouteGuard>
  ) : (
    <AuthRequired />
  )}
</Route>
Ensure ProjectProfilePage (or equivalent) accepts an editMode prop and, when true, displays the project profile form pre‐filled for editing.

3. Verify and Test
Console Logs: Confirm you see Complete setup clicked for project: <id> in the browser console.

Navigation: Clicking “Complete setup” routes to /projects/<id>/setup.

Page Behavior: The project profile form appears in edit mode with all fields pre‐filled.

Fallback: If projectId is missing or invalid, redirect back to /organisations.

Definition of Done
“Complete setup” button navigates correctly on click.

Setup URL /projects/:projectId/setup exists and renders the edit form.

No console errors, no empty handlers, and pre‐filled form loads every time.

Please implement these changes and confirm the button now works end-to-end.
