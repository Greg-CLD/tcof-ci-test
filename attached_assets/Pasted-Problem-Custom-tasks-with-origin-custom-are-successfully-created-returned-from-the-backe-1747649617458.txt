Problem:
Custom tasks (with `"origin": "custom"`) are successfully created, returned from the backend API, and visible in the API response. However, these custom tasks do **not** appear in the checklist UI—neither under "All Sources", "Custom Tasks", nor after a page refresh. Console logs confirm the tasks are present in the server data, but disappear after the grouping/filtering step on the client.

Expected outcome:
Custom tasks (origin: "custom") should appear in the checklist UI:
- Under "All Sources", they should be visible in the appropriate stage tab.
- Under "Custom Tasks" or "General", they should always appear.
- After a page reload, they should persist and still be visible.
- They should never disappear at any filter setting.

Tech details:
- Server API response returns these tasks with `"origin": "custom"` and correct `projectId`, `stage`, etc.
- ChecklistFilterBar uses `source`/`origin` values for filters (see mappings).
- Grouping and filtering code is in `Checklist.tsx`, including state like `projectTasks`, `allTasks`, `tasksByStage`, and `filteredTasks`.
- UI filter dropdowns map "Custom Tasks" and "General" to `"custom"` internally.
- No code should drop or filter out tasks with `origin: "custom"`.

Safeguards:
- Do **not** change server-side task creation or API logic—API is correct.
- Do **not** change filter dropdown display names or mappings unless necessary.
- Do **not** remove any existing task types.
- Do **not** introduce new task fields; use existing `origin` and `source` fields only.

Steps:
1. Investigate how custom tasks are mapped, grouped, and filtered after fetching.
2. Fix any mismatch or logic error so that all custom tasks (`origin: "custom"`) flow correctly from API response to UI, regardless of filter.
3. Confirm that:
   - A new custom task appears instantly in the correct stage and under "All Sources" and "Custom Tasks".
   - It persists after page reload.
   - All existing custom tasks in the server response are visible and never disappear.
4. Add a brief comment in the codebase referencing this bug and its fix.
5. Do **not** change unrelated functionality or introduce excessive logging.

Definition of done:
- Custom tasks show up consistently in the UI and survive all filter and reload scenarios.
- At least one manual test (by user) confirms "Debug-XYZ" or similar test task appears after adding.

After the fix, run the full checklist smoke test and confirm that the bug is resolved.
