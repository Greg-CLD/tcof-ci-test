Please apply the following fixes to Block 2 so it matches the expected workflow and corrects current issues.

───────────────────────────────
1. ❌ REMOVE "Stage" SELECTION DROPDOWN

• On Block 2, remove the standalone “Stage” dropdown at the top of the page unless it's required for functionality.
• This was not part of the spec and adds confusion.
• Do not break any task stage-assignment logic.

───────────────────────────────
2. ✅ STEP 3 – FIX USER HEURISTICS NOT LOADING

• Source: Use plan.personalHeuristics saved from Block 1 → Step 2.
• This should be an array of { id, text, favourite }.
• Display each heuristic as an option in a multi-select dropdown for mapping to the 12 canonical TCOF success factors.
• Store mapped results in plan.heuristicLinks = { heuristicId: [factorId,…] }

───────────────────────────────
3. ✅ STEP 4 – CORRECT TARGETS FOR TASK ENTRY

• Currently, Step 4 shows **TCOF success factors** as the base for task entry — this is incorrect.
• Instead, Step 4 should:
   – Only display **user heuristics** that have NOT been mapped in Step 3.
   – For each, allow user to add tasks per stage (Identification, Definition, Delivery, Closure).
• UI should reuse the same admin-style FactorTaskEditor (e.g. used in /admin/factors) but apply it to these user heuristics.
• Do not show TCOF heuristics here — they are already handled separately.

───────────────────────────────
4. 💾 TASK STORAGE

• All tasks entered in Step 4 should be stored in:
   plan.stages[stage].tasks[] where each task has:
   {
     origin: 'userHeuristic',
     heuristicId: 'user-h1',
     text: 'Run stakeholder workshop',
     stage: 'Identification'
   }

───────────────────────────────
5. 🧪 TEST CASES TO CONFIRM

• Block 1: Add 3 personal heuristics.
• Block 2 Step 3: Map 1 of them to a TCOF factor.
• Step 4: Only 2 unlinked heuristics should show.
• Add tasks to 1 of the 2 → Confirm they appear in the checklist.
• Confirm mapped heuristic from Step 3 does NOT appear in Step 4.

FILES LIKELY TO TOUCH
• pages/Block2Connect.tsx
• components/FactorTaskEditor.tsx
• utils/planHelpers.ts (for stage + heuristic linking)
• planStore or localStorage handler
