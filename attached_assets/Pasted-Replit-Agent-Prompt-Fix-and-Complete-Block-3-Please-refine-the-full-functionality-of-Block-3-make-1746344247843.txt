Replit Agent Prompt: Fix and Complete Block 3
Please refine the full functionality of Block 3 (/make-a-plan/full/block-3). This block includes Steps 6–8 and should match the final design, content structure, and UX expectations outlined below.

🧱 Step 6 – Delivery Approach (Praxis Quadrant Tool)
✅ Chart Layout:

Flip the quadrant chart to match the Praxis Framework:

Y-axis: Uncertainty (Low at bottom, High at top)

X-axis: Scope (Simple at left, Complex at right)

Top-right = High Scope / High Uncertainty

✅ Zone Mapping:

Use 6 clear zones with friendly names:

Zone A – Fast & Focused (Small + Low)

Zone B – Adaptive Projects

Zone C – Iterative Delivery

Zone D – Agile/Hybrid Delivery

Zone E – Complex Adaptive

Zone F – Systems Thinking (if needed for outliers)

✅ Summary Panel:

After user selection, show a panel with:

Friendly zone name

2-line description of delivery style

Suggested methods (Agile, PRINCE2, Systems Thinking, etc.)

Techniques (e.g. Critical Path, Kanban, Monte Carlo)

Button to export/copy summary (PDF or clipboard)

✅ Intro Text Above Chart:
Add:

“Use this tool to identify the right delivery approach. Based on your project’s scope and clarity, we’ll recommend styles and techniques to guide your next steps.”

✅ Style:

Fix misaligned text ("Scope" label is cut off)

Use TCOF brand styles and colour scheme

🧱 Step 7 – Add Good Practice Tasks
✅ Praxis Tasks:

These should still load based on delivery zone selected in Step 6

User can preview and tick relevant tasks to include in their checklist

✅ Custom Frameworks:

Add section: “Custom Frameworks”

Use the same UI pattern as Step 4 and Step 5:

Allow users to name a framework (e.g. “Client Model X”)

Then add up to 4 tasks per delivery stage

Use clear tabs or vertical list for Identification, Definition, Delivery, Closure

✅ User Experience:

Replace system auto-IDs with friendly format like:
Custom 01 - [Stage] - Task [#]

Add placeholder text in task fields (e.g. “Enter task for this stage…”)

Trigger autosave on:

Pressing Enter

Clicking “Add Task”

Field blur (user clicks away)

✅ Toast Notification:

Brief message like: ✅ “Task saved for [Framework Name] – [Stage]”

🧱 Step 8 – Finalise Checklist
✅ Button:

Add a “Generate My Checklist” button

✅ On Click:

Automatically compile all tasks into checklist

Canonical 12 Success Factors + Tasks

Any Personal Heuristic Tasks (if not linked)

Any Good Practice Tasks (from Step 7)

Any Organisational Policy Tasks (from Step 5)

Any Custom Framework Tasks

✅ Checklist Routing:

Route user to /make-a-plan/checklist

✅ Optional Exports:

Let user copy, download PDF, or email to themselves
