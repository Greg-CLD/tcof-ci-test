Thanks for your detailed update and for implementing the fixes and tests. However, I am still seeing a 200 response with content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8 on the PUT endpoint in live testing. This means that despite the changes and passing smoke/unit tests, there are still code paths where the response is not JSON (HTML is returned, likely the SPA fallback).
Please respond to the following:

1. No further React/DevTools UI or UX tests needed at this stage.
2. Here’s what I still need from you (please number your responses):
	1. The exact Browser Network row for a failing PUT (full URL, JSON body, status, response headers, response body).
	2. The Server console output for that PUT (including [TASK_LOOKUP], [TASK_UPDATE_ERROR], and any fallthrough/final handler logs).
	3. The Latest GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks JSON output immediately after the PUT.
	4. The full smoke-test JSON result (including pass/fail and test output, not just a summary).
	5. The latest git commit hash and message related to this task update.
	6. The SSR start logs (output from the app restart after the latest code change).
3. If you propose any new code, please include a one-block copy-pasteable JS/TS code file with a summary at the top.

Key Problem:
Despite all recent fixes, a PUT with an invalid or missing task ID, or certain error scenarios, still returns HTML with status 200. This is not expected or acceptable. I need to see the precise path that causes this and the raw logs/output from both browser and server for the next failing request.
If you need a failing request example, use a random or non-existent task ID.

Please ensure:
	• Every possible code path in the PUT handler returns a JSON response and a suitable HTTP status code.
	• No error, invalid, or missing task/project scenario should ever return HTML or 200 with text/html.

Next step:
Please collect and paste the numbered artifacts above so I can help pinpoint the last gap. If your tests show “all green” but this is reproducible in the browser, please investigate any possible proxy, middleware, or catch-all route that may be affecting this path.
