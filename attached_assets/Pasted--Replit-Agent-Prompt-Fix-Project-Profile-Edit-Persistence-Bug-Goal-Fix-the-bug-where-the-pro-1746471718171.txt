🛠️ Replit Agent Prompt – Fix Project Profile Edit Persistence Bug
🎯 Goal
Fix the bug where the project profile form does not persist changes after editing. When a user edits a project profile and saves, the data should be stored and correctly shown next time they visit the form.

✅ Checklist
Frontend Fixes

 Ensure the useEffect in ProjectProfile.tsx correctly populates the form using the project object.

 Confirm the form.reset() fields align exactly with the schema and backend payload.

 Check that the form submit handler includes all expected fields in the PUT request.

 Ensure no empty or default values are accidentally overwriting valid existing values.

Backend Fixes

 Verify that the PUT /api/projects/:id endpoint correctly receives and updates the project data using projectsDb.updateProject(...).

 Ensure the updateProject function updates all profile-related fields: sector, customSector, orgType, teamSize, currentStage.

 Add logging or console output (temporarily) to confirm which fields are received in the PUT body.

Database Sanity

 Confirm the projects table is not being overwritten with null or empty values unintentionally.

Form Schema

 Validate that the form schema (Zod) aligns exactly with the field names used in both the backend and the form reset logic.

 Adjust optional/required settings if needed to prevent validation rejections.

✅ Definition of Done
Editing a project correctly updates all fields (e.g. sector type).

After clicking Save, returning to the project shows the correct previously saved values in the form.

No fields go blank unless intentionally cleared by the user.

The fix is made directly in the dev environment. No backup, no rollback planning — just fix it.

✅ Smoke Test Cases
Edit a project → change sector → save → refresh page → sector should remain updated.

Add a customSector value → save → return → value should be present.

Change multiple fields (e.g. orgType, teamSize) → save → return → all should persist.

Validate frontend logs: PUT request payload includes correct data.

Validate backend logs: updateProject() updates correct fields and returns 200 OK.

🚨 Important
This is a development environment. You have permission to make bold, direct changes. There are no users. The only goal is to fix this persistence issue.
