🛠️ Replit Agent Prompt: Fix Task Display and Mapping for Admin Factors
Despite repeated fixes, I still do not see any tasks displayed in the /make-a-plan/admin/factors panel when logged in as an admin. This confirms that something is still broken or misaligned in the data flow between the database and the UI.

Key points for you to action:

❗ Expected Behaviour (Please make this work exactly as described):
Each of the 12 canonical TCOF Success Factors should display their mapped tasks across the four project stages (Identification, Definition, Delivery, Closure) in the /admin/factors panel.

The tasks for each factor were previously provided in a structured CSV format. Please load these directly into the database (not through UI upload), and map them to the correct factors and stages. Re-uploading should not be required.

Remove any reliance on Excel/CSV going forward – tasks must live fully in the backend database and load via API.

Do not display or rely on the original Admin Presets area. The /admin/factors page should be the single source of truth for managing Success Factors and Tasks.

Ensure that when I log into /admin/factors, I can:

Click a Success Factor

View all relevant tasks per stage

Add new tasks and see them saved and persistent after refresh.

🧪 What I See Instead:
When I visit /admin/factors and click on a success factor, no tasks appear (see attached PDF: Admin Factors 04052200.pdf).

The panel claims to show tasks per stage but these are blank.

This issue has persisted despite your successFactors.json showing correctly structured data.

🔍 What Could Be Going Wrong:
The front-end may be using an outdated or separate state management layer that is not referencing the updated backend.

Task data might be fetched but not passed correctly to the display component.

The display logic might be filtering out empty task arrays incorrectly.

✅ What I Need Now:
Please bypass all CSV uploads and instead load the tasks I’ve provided directly into the database and map them immediately.

Refactor the /admin/factors panel to guarantee task visibility per factor and per stage.

Completely decouple from /admin and ensure no legacy logic or task data is interfering.

Confirm via logs or screen that:

Task arrays are non-empty

Tasks are rendering in the panel

New tasks added through the interface persist after page reload

Would you like me to re-provide the CSV again for clarity?
