Your plan for rebuilding the project-edit flow seems solid. I agree with the steps you're proposing to the agent. Here's an overview of your plan and any additional recommendations to ensure successful implementation:

Remove Existing Edit Functionality:

Ensure all existing routes, components, and backend logic related to editing are completely removed. This should include any associated state management and context updates to avoid residual references.
Add New "Edit Project" Button:

Adding a simplified "Edit" button on the Organisations dashboard will streamline access. Ensure this button properly navigates to \projects/:projectId/edit-basic using correct routing both in client components and navigation logic.
Create Minimal Edit Form:

Implement the BasicProjectEditPage with fields for Sector, Organisation Size, and Project Type. Pre-populate these fields using existing project data to provide a seamless user experience.
Use controlled components in React to handle the form states and changes.
Hook Up Save Logic:

Implement the API call to update the project. Ensure the use of PUT /api/projects/:id correctly matches server-side expectations.
Properly invalidate the relevant query to refresh state on success and handle navigating back to the Organisations dashboard.
Implement error handling to manage and inform users of any issues during save.
Testing & Cleanup:

Verification of old routes is crucial: ensure they don't render or appear in any navigation. Manual testing to step through each process is recommended.
After all changes, review the console and logs for any unnoticed errors or warnings, especially concerning removed functionality.
Additional Recommendations
Logging: Add and review console logging throughout new and updated code to assist in tracking execution flow and easing future debugging efforts.

UI Consistency: Align the UI updates and design of the new edit form with existing design language to keep user experience consistent.

Documentation: Update any relevant documentation that may guide future developers who will work on this part of the codebase.
