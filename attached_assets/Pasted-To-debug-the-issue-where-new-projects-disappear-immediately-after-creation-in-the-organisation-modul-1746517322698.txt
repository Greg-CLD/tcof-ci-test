To debug the issue where new projects disappear immediately after creation in the organisation module, let's delve into the details:

Network Trace:
POST /api/projects: This request is triggered when a new project is created.

Check the payload sent with this request. It should contain the project details including name, description, and organisationId.
Ensure the server responds with a 201 status and the correct project data in JSON format.
GET /api/organisations/:orgId/projects: This request is triggered to refetch projects after the new project is created.

Ensure this GET request is indeed triggered and check the response payload for the correct projects list, including the newly created project.
Query Configuration in OrganisationDashboardPage.tsx:
useMutation for createProjectMutation:
Confirm that onSuccess correctly invalidates the cache with invalidateQueries on ['orgProjects', orgId].
Log the response data here to verify what new data is fetched/returned.
// Example logging in `onSuccess`
onSuccess: (newProject) => {
  console.log("Created project:", newProject);
  // Existing logic...
}
useQuery for projects:
Check the useQuery for projects to ensure refetchOnWindowFocus is set appropriately.
Log the response data in onSuccess to verify the fetched array.
// Example logging in query fetch
const { data: projects = [], isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['orgProjects', orgId],
  onSuccess: (fetchedProjects) => {
    console.log("Fetched projects:", fetchedProjects);
  },
  // Existing logic...
});
React Query Global Defaults:
Ensure there are no default options like staleTime or cacheTime settings globally overriding your expectations and causing stale or outdated project lists to display.
Action Summary:
To resolve:

Add logging to onSuccess of both useMutation and useQuery calls to verify data at key points.
Review network trace via DevTools to ensure both requests and responses are behaving as expected.
Pay special attention to HTTP status codes and response payloads during these operations.
Ensure the key in invalidateQueries matches exactly with what's used in the query for projects.
By inspecting these areas, you should identify if the backend isn't returning the new project or if the frontend cache is not updating.
