Context
You previously created:

a new homepage with two CTA cards (Get Your Bearings, Make a Plan)

individual pages for “Get Your Bearings” (with the three existing tools) and “Make a Plan” (placeholder).

New requirements

Global navigation – replace the current nav with:

Starter Kit (top-level menu item)

Get Your Bearings – route /get-your-bearings

Make a Plan – route /make-a-plan

Checklist – route /checklist (keep it hidden/disabled until the user has started a plan).

Keep the site logo on the far left; nothing else is needed in the header for now.

Routing & placeholders – make sure the three existing tools still open under /get-your-bearings exactly as before. Keep the simple placeholder page under /make-a-plan; we will flesh it out later.

Checklist groundwork – create a minimal Replit DB (or a helper that can be swapped for Replit DB) with one collection/table called plans. A single plan record should contain:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "created": "<ISO date>",
  "stages": {           // Identification | Definition | Delivery | Closure
    "Identification": { "heuristics": [], "factors": [], "practiceTasks": [] },
    "Definition":      { … },
    "Delivery":        { … },
    "Closure":         { … }
  }
}
For now just implement the helper functions:

createEmptyPlan() → returns an id, inserts empty record

loadPlan(id)

savePlan(id, data)
We will call these from later pages.

Design system bootstrap – create a small CSS module (or Tailwind config if you prefer) with shared classes for:

.btn-primary – background #008080 teal, white text

.btn-secondary – outline teal, transparent background

.nav-link.active – underline or bold

.skip-for-now – secondary button style

Page-level design notes (to apply on every future “Block” page, but just include the CSS / component stubs now):

Step-by-step guidance area at top

Editable table/form area

Button row with Back · Next · Save progress · Skip for now

Optional Skip to Summary link that goes to /checklist.
No need to build Block pages yet—just set up reusable components (e.g. ProgressNav, ActionButtons).

QA reminder – after updates, run the dev server and verify:

New nav appears on every page.

Links work.

/checklist route exists but shows “Start a plan to see your checklist”.

Replit DB helper file is present with the three functions above.

Goal for this prompt
Commit the updated navigation header, home page, new CSS/module, helper DB file, and any router updates. Do not remove any existing tool code. Provide a short summary of which files you changed or added.
