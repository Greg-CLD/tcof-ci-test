We‚Äôre experiencing persistent problems relying on an uploaded Excel file to populate TCOF Success Factors and their tasks. Please remove this dependency on spreadsheets and instead follow this new architecture:

1. ‚úÖ **Initial Data Source:**
   - I am uploading a JSON file named `tcof_success_factors_v2.json` containing all TCOF success factors and associated tasks for each of the four stages.
   - This JSON file contains an array of success factor objects, each with the following structure:
     {
       "title": "1.1 Ask Why",
       "tasks": {
         "Identification": ["Example task 1", "Example task 2"],
         "Definition": [...],
         "Delivery": [...],
         "Closure": [...]
       }
     }

2. ‚úÖ **Database Storage:**
   - Store the success factors and tasks permanently in the Replit DB or another server-side JSON file, not in memory or localStorage.
   - On app load, the system should read this saved JSON from the database directly, not from a file upload.

3. ‚úÖ **Admin Panel:**
   - The admin editor page should:
     - Load success factors and tasks from the stored database file.
     - Let me manually edit and save the list.
     - Allow me to add new factors, rename them, or change tasks per stage.
     - Provide an option to reset all factors from the uploaded `tcof_success_factors_v2.json`.

4. ‚úÖ **Step 1 Page:**
   - Display **all success factor titles only** (from the saved DB), for reflection and rating.
   - Include the emoji rating scale with a hover-over or static key:
     - ‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt land (1)
     - ü§î Unfamiliar (2)
     - üü° Seems true (3)
     - ‚úÖ Proven (4)
     - üî• Hard-won truth (5)

5. ‚úÖ **Checklist Page:**
   - Preload the checklist with all tasks from every success factor, grouped under each stage.
   - These should appear under the ‚ÄúTCOF Success Factors‚Äù section in the checklist.
   - Any deletions or edits should not affect the database but be saved per-user via localStorage or session.

6. ‚úÖ **User Experience:**
   - Eliminate any spreadsheet loaders or parsing logic on the frontend.
   - Provide clear confirmation messages when tasks or factors are saved.
   - Ensure the full list loads correctly on app refresh.

Once complete, I should be able to update the full success factors list either via JSON upload (admin only) or the admin editor interface, with the changes reflected everywhere in the app.

Please confirm which files or components you‚Äôve updated to implement this new architecture.
