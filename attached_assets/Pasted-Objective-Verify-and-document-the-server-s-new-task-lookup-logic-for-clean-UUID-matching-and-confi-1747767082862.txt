Objective: Verify and document the server’s new task lookup logic for clean UUID matching, and confirm correct operation with full logs.

Problem:
The server’s updateTask and deleteTask functions now match on both exact taskId and "startsWith" for clean UUIDs. However, we have not received the critical output/logs needed to fully confirm and debug this behavior with real PUT requests and a full round-trip (network, SSR, and DB).

Expected outcome:
• [TASK_LOOKUP] logs appear in the server console, showing how the matching logic works for an update.
• PUT request network logs are present in the browser (request URL, body, and response).
• The GET /tasks response JSON after a task update shows the updated completion state for the affected task.
• A commit confirmation is present for the last server-side change.
• The smoke-test script is run and its JSON output is pasted.
• If the app restarts, SSR logs are pasted.

Tech details:
- **NO CODE CHANGES NEEDED THIS CYCLE**
- This cycle is for log/output gathering only.
- Do not edit UI, DB, or auth; only paste requested logs.
- Do not re-run any test scripts unless explicitly specified.

Safeguards:
- Do not modify updateTask, deleteTask, or cleanTaskId logic.
- Do not introduce new logic or revert recent fixes.
- Only collect and paste the required logs.

Checklist of required outputs:
1. **PUT Request (Network Tab):**
   - Full URL, request payload, and response code/body for toggling a SuccessFactor task.
2. **[TASK_LOOKUP] logs from server console:**
   - Paste server log output showing lookup logic during the PUT request.
3. **Full GET /tasks JSON response:**
   - Run GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks after updating, paste full JSON for that project.
4. **Commit confirmation:**
   - Paste the commit message or ID for the most recent server-side change.
5. **Smoke-test script output:**
   - Run: DEBUG=true DEBUG_TASKS=true DEBUG_TASK_STATE=true DEBUG_TASK_COMPLETION=true DEBUG_TASK_PERSISTENCE=true DEBUG_TASK_API=true node test-state-transitions-smoke.mjs
   - Paste full JSON result.
6. **SSR logs if restarted:**
   - Paste server-side rendering logs on restart.

End of cycle:
Once all outputs above are pasted, STOP. Do not make further changes or apply new fixes until outputs are reviewed.

Run smoke-test script and paste its JSON result. If you restart the app, wait for SSR logs and include them.
