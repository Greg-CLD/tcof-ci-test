Hi Agent,

We’ve resolved the infinite-loop problem, but several navigation and page-content bugs remain. Please implement the fixes below so we can return to smooth Organisation work.

✅ Required Fixes
Post-Login Landing Page

Authenticated users must land on /organisations immediately after login (not root /, and not /get-your-bearings).

In App.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (user && location === '/') {
  navigate('/organisations');
  return null; // guard so it runs once
}
Clean Up Global Navigation (SiteHeader.tsx)

Remove “Project Profile” and “Checklist” from the nav bar for all views.

Keep only: Home (public landing), Organisations, and Pricing (visible when logged out).

Remove Legacy /get-your-bearings Top-Level Page

Delete its route from App.tsx.

Tool links should stay under /tools/* or /projects/:id/*—not /get-your-bearings at root.

Fix Organisations Page (blank screen)

When visiting /organisations:

Fetch and display a card list of the user’s organisations.

Each card must have “View” and “Delete” (trash icon) buttons.

Deleting should open a confirmation dialog: “Delete this organisation? This removes all its projects.”

On confirm, call DELETE /api/organisations/:id, then invalidate ['/api/organisations'].

Add a “New Organisation” button that opens the existing create dialog.

If no organisations exist, show a friendly empty-state with a call-to-action to “Create Organisation”.

Backend Endpoint for Delete

Implement DELETE /api/organisations/:id in server/routes/organisations.js with an ownership/membership check and cascading delete.

Smoke-Test Flow

Log in → lands on /organisations.

Create new organisation → appears in list.

Delete organisation → confirmation dialog → disappears from list.

Click an organisation → project dashboard still works.

📣 Reminders
If you add/alter DB columns or constraints, update schema, create migration, run migration, verify DB reflects changes.

Keep page layouts single-sourced (no extra SiteHeader or nested routers in pages).

Let me know once the fixes are live and the smoke test passes.
