Please implement the following fixes to improve the UX and functionality of Steps 3, 4, and 5 in Block 2 (/make-a-plan/full/block-2).

───────────────────────────────
✅ STEP 3 – ADD "DOES NOT APPLY" OPTION

• Add an option to the TCOF Success Factor selector labelled:
   → “❓ No Match / Doesn’t Apply”
• This should allow users to intentionally skip mapping a heuristic.
• Internally, store this as `null` or a special flag like `none` so the heuristic is handled correctly in Step 4 (i.e. still appears for task assignment).

───────────────────────────────
✅ STEP 4 – FIX DISPLAY & TEXT ENTRY

1. **Remove Database ID from Heuristic Label**
• In the "Select Item" dropdown (left panel), remove the long ID prefix.
• Only show the heuristic's plain title as written by the user.

2. **Fix Text Input Field for Tasks**
• Currently, when users begin typing in the task entry field, the text disappears or behaves erratically.
• Expected: Typing should behave normally, with input visible and usable from the start.

3. **Implement Autosave Indicator**
• After typing and clicking away or hitting Enter, auto-save the task.
• Display a small confirmation (e.g. ✅ “Saved”) that briefly appears near the field or in the corner and fades after 1.5s.
• This will help reassure users that their input has been captured.

───────────────────────────────
✅ STEP 5 – REBUILD ORGANISATIONAL POLICY TASKS

• Allow the user to define one or more policy "buckets" or categories (e.g. "Change Process", "Risk Guidelines").

1. **Left Panel: Policy Selector**
• User should be able to:
   – Create a new policy group
   – See existing policies (with edit/delete option)

2. **Right Panel: Add Tasks per Policy**
• Once a policy is selected, allow the user to add tasks by stage, using the same UI pattern as Step 4.
• These tasks should be stored under:
   → plan.orgPolicies[policyId].tasks = [{ stage, text }]

3. **Consistency**
• Use the same FactorTaskEditor UI pattern as used in Step 4 and /admin/factors for visual consistency.

───────────────────────────────
NOTES ON STORAGE

• Ensure heuristic-task and policy-task data is stored in plan.tasks or plan.orgPolicies in a format that allows them to be exported into the final checklist.

FILES LIKELY TO UPDATE

• Block2Connect.tsx or Block2Editor
• Step3MapHeuristics.tsx
• Step4TaskBuilder.tsx
• Step5OrgPolicies.tsx (or create if missing)
