🎯 Critical Bug
After I click **+ New Project → Create Project**, the checklist opens,
but when I return to the dashboard the new project is missing.
We need bullet-proof project persistence before we advance.

────────────────────────────────
🚀 Bold, Clean Fix
1️⃣  Back-end: Projects Store
• Create /data/projects.json (or Replit DB collection “projects”) with schema:
  {
    projectId,         // UUID
    userId,            // owner
    name,
    description,
    createdAt,
    updatedAt
  }

• Implement helpers in server/projectsDb.ts:
  ▸ createProject(userId, data)   -> returns saved record
  ▸ listProjects(userId)          -> returns user’s projects
  ▸ updateProject(projectId, …)   (stub for future)

• Replace any “plan” hacks with these helpers.

2️⃣  API Routes  (server/routes.ts)
POST  /api/projects          → createProject
GET   /api/projects          → listProjects for current user
Both routes guarded by auth middleware.

3️⃣  Front-end
Home / Dashboard component:
• useQuery("projects", GET /api/projects)
• After Create Project succeeds, optimistically
  add the returned project to React-Query cache
  so it appears instantly without full reload.

Project-create modal / New Project dialog:
• On submit → call POST /api/projects
• Await response → navigate to GetYourBearings start route

4️⃣  Delete “createEmptyPlan” shortcut
Remove any temp functions that bypassed the API and wrote
straight to a file; they cause the missing-project bug.

5️⃣  Validation
• Console-log on POST save: “Project saved → ${projectId}”
• Console-log on dashboard load: list length
• Manual test:
   – Log in as Greg@confluity.co.uk
   – Create Project A
   – Return home → Project A card visible
   – Refresh browser → Project A still visible
   – Create Project B → both A & B visible

No Excel/CSV logic is needed for projects.

Once this persistence fix is live and stable, let me know
so I can proceed with Prompt 1 (Project Profile form).
