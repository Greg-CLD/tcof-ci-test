# Success Factor Task Persistence Fix

## Problem Summary
Task toggles were failing when a Success Factor task ID existed in multiple projects but was being requested from a project where it didn't belong. This caused 404 or 500 errors, resulting in lost task state updates.

## Root Cause
The core issue was in the task update flow, where:
1. Success Factor tasks shared the same sourceId across multiple projects
2. Frontend requests used incorrect project context when toggling tasks 
3. Server-side validation didn't verify task ownership before processing updates
4. When requesting /api/projects/projectA/tasks/taskIdFromProjectB, the server couldn't find the task

## Implemented Solution

### Server-Side Fixes
1. Added `PROJECT_MISMATCH` error code to `TaskErrorCodes` enum
2. Enhanced server validation to explicitly check that tasks belong to the requested project
3. Added detailed error response for cross-project update attempts with proper status codes
4. Added diagnostic logging to track project context during task updates

### Client-Side Fixes
1. Added `projectId` to the `TaskUpdates` interface for cross-validation
2. Created a `validateProjectContext()` helper in TaskCard to prevent invalid updates
3. Enhanced all update handlers (toggle, priority change, date change, detail edits)
4. Added detailed logging to track project context mismatches

### Testing
1. Created end-to-end test script (`test-success-factor-persistence.js`) to verify:
   - Project mismatch protection blocks cross-project updates
   - Legitimate updates within the correct project succeed
   - Task state properly persists after updates
   - Critical Success Factor metadata (sourceId, origin) is preserved during updates

## Benefits
- Ensures tasks can only be updated within their owning project context
- Prevents 404/500 errors when attempting to update tasks from the wrong project
- Provides clear error messages for invalid update attempts
- Preserves task metadata during legitimate updates
- Improves debugging capabilities with enhanced logging
