# Success Factor Task Persistence Fix

## Problem Summary
Tasks with the same `sourceId` across different projects were not properly isolated, leading to cross-project task updates when using `sourceId` for lookups. This caused updates to Success Factor tasks in one project to incorrectly affect tasks in other projects.

## Root Cause
The task ID resolver was looking up tasks by `sourceId` without enforcing project boundaries, allowing tasks from any project to be found and updated.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Success Factor Seeding
- Modified `getAllSuccessFactors()` in `cloneSuccessFactors.ts` to be resilient to missing `created_at` column
- Added specific column selection and fallback hardcoded values for development
- Ensures all 12 canonical Success Factors are available even when database lookup fails

### 2. Project Boundary Enforcement
- Verified that `findTasksBySourceIdInProject` in `projectsDb.ts` properly enforces project boundaries
- Confirmed `taskIdResolver.ts` uses this method on line 210
- Added an additional check on line 217-223 to verify the task belongs to the correct project

### 3. Testing
- Created verification scripts to test the fixes work correctly
- Set up an integration test that verifies:
  - Tasks in Project A can be updated correctly
  - Attempts to update tasks using `sourceId` from another project fail with 404
  - Cross-project task state isolation is maintained

## Files Changed
- `server/cloneSuccessFactors.ts`: Fixed handling of missing `created_at` column in Success Factors
- `server/services/taskIdResolver.ts`: Confirmed proper use of project boundary enforcement
- `tests/integration/factor-toggle-boundary.spec.ts`: Added integration test for boundary enforcement

## Verification Results
- ✅ Success Factor tasks can be properly loaded and cloned to new projects
- ✅ Updating a task in Project A does not affect tasks in Project B
- ✅ Using a `sourceId` from Project A in a Project B context fails with 404
- ✅ Project boundary enforcement is properly maintained

## Result
Success Factor task persistence now works reliably across all projects, with proper isolation between projects containing tasks with the same `sourceId`.
