# Task Persistence Fix Summary

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
   - Added detailed `[TASK_LOOKUP]` debug output to track how tasks are matched during operations
   - Log includes `rawId` (incoming ID), `matchedId` (actual DB ID), and `matchedVia` (exact or prefix)

2. **UUID Matching Logic**
   - Fixed task operations to use actual matched database IDs for operations
   - Implemented a 4-step matching process:
     1. Check if source ID matches an existing task
     2. Look for exact ID match
     3. Search for clean UUID prefix match in compound IDs
     4. Improved error for no match found

3. **Factor vs Task ID Protection**
   - Added validation to detect when a success factor ID is mistakenly used as a task ID
   - Prevents accidental updates/deletions when passing the wrong ID type
   - Provides meaningful error messages to help troubleshoot

4. **Testing**
   - Created unit test for UUID matching logic
   - Developed smoke test scripts to validate task operations with different ID formats
   - Built debug tools to help analyze UUID matching behavior

## Code Changes

1. In `updateTask` function:
   - Use matched task ID (`validTaskId`) for database operations
   - Detect and reject factor IDs mistakenly used as task IDs
   - Include debug logs showing before/after state

2. In `deleteTask` function:
   - Similar improvements to use matched database ID
   - Added validation for factor vs task ID distinction
   - Enhanced error messages with more context

## Verification

The implementation has been verified through:
- Debug logging analysis
- Unit testing
- Manual smoke testing
- Integration testing with the front end

## Next Steps

1. Monitor server logs for any remaining issues with task persistence
2. Consider adding additional client-side UUID cleaning logic
3. Continue testing with other task operations (bulk updates, etc.)
